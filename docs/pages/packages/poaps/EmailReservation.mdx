# Email Reservation

A POAP can be reserved with an email where to receive the instructions to mint
the it to the blockchain in the future. The email could be not be send in cases
that another email is send in their place or the collector knows already how to
mint it afterwards.

```typescript
import { POAPReservation } from '@poap-xyz/poaps';

const emailReservation: POAPReservation = await client.emailReservation({
  mintCode: 'your_poap_code',
  email: 'your@email.io',
  sendEmail: true,
});
```

This method can throw [custom errors](Errors) that need to handled.
