# Compass Provider

To query Compass, a simple request wrapper is provided. To initialize it you'll need an API key.

```typescript
import { PoapCompass } from '@poap-xyz/providers';

const compass = new PoapCompass({
  apiKey: 'my-secret-api-key',
});
```

## Requests

Query requests can be made by giving the query in string and optionally the variables to pass. All
successful requests are returned as an object with a `data` property where the structure differs
depending on the query done. When the request fails, errors are thrown instead.

### Querying

To do a query request, a response data type is needed and, in the case the query accepts variables,
a type for its structure is also needed.

For example, if we want to retrieve the last POAP token ids we could have the query:

```typescript
const query = `
  query LastTokenIds($limit: Int!) {
    poaps(limit: $limit, order_by: { id: desc }) {
      id
    }
  }
`;
```

Which will return the type:

```typescript
type LastTokenIdsResponse = {
  poaps: Array<{
    id: number;
  }>;
};
```

And have the variables type:

```typescript
type LastTokenIdsVariables = {
  limit: number;
};
```

Then the query can be executed:

```typescript
const lastTokenIds: number[] = [];
try {
  const { data } = await compass.request<
    LastTokenIdsResponse,
    LastTokenIdsVariables
  >(query, { limit: 3 });

  lastTokenIds.push(
    ...data.poaps.map((poap) => poap.id)
  );
} catch (error: unknown) {
  console.error(error)
}
```

### Errors

There are two types of errors, HTTP errors and requests errors. The former are thrown when there is
an issue with the HTTP requests itself and the latter when the query has some malformed or
unavailable structure.

#### HTTP errors

When the HTTP request is malformed a `CompassBadRequestError` is thrown, which should not happen
unless there is a migration to be made. When the API key given is incorrect or expired, then a
`CompassUnauthorizedError` error will be thrown.

#### Query errors

All errors derived from a malformed structure on the query will throw a `CompassRequestError` which
has a public property called `errors` of the type `CompassError` with more information about what
went wrong.

## Batch Requests

It is possible to do many requests that only differs on the variables given to the same
query. Such requests will be done in batch not to overload the server.

For example, if what we want is to retrieve collectors of a drop:

```typescript
const total = 800; // Number of collectors we want to retrieve
const limit = 100; // Number of collectors we retrieve per page

const MY_DROP_COLLECTORS_QUERY = `
  query MyDropCollectors(
    $offset: Int
    $limit: Int
  ) {
    poaps(
      where: {
        drop_id: { _eq: 151249 }
      }
      offset: $offset
      limit: $limit
    ) {
      collector_address
    }
  }
`;

type CollectorsQueryResponse = {
  poaps: Array<{
    collector_address: string;
  }>;
};

const responses = await compass.batch<
  CollectorsQueryResponse,
  PaginatedVariables
>(
  MY_DROP_COLLECTORS_QUERY,
  Array.from(
    { length: Math.ceil(total / limit) },
    (_, page): PaginatedVariables => ({
      offset: page * limit,
      limit: limit,
    }),
  ),
);

const collectors = responses.reduce(
  (addresses, response) => [
    ...addresses,
    ...response.data.poaps.map((poap) => poap.collector_address),
  ],
  [],
);
```

In this case, we are doing eight requests but in two groups requested in parallel, one of
five and one of three requests.
