# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- Removes `HttpProvider`.
- Rename query utils to create filters and order by.

- Compass variables can be typed.
- Compass throws errors on malformed requests/queries.

## 0.5.0

- Packages do not export input types anymore.
- Drop properties are not exported anymore.

## 0.6.0

- `createMoment` does not upload media beforehand anymore. Use `createMomentAndUploadMedia` instead.
- For compass requests, the fetch signal is not a parameter of the `PoapCompass.request` method anymore, it must be given through the new `options` parameter: `compass.request(url, { variables }, { signal })`.

## 0.7.0

- `dropId` has been changed to `dropIds` on the Moment type. It is now an array of 0 to multiple numerical IDs.
  - This change is reflected in both the Moment creation input and the Moment response during creation or fetching.
- The CID is no longer a property of the Moment type.
- The token ID is no longer a property of the Moment type.
- `patchMoment` is no longer a method of the Moments client.
- It is no longer possible to order fetched Moments by token ID or drop ID.

## 0.8.0

- `createBoolFilter` in `@poap-xyz/utils` has been removed. Use `createEqFilter('...', true | false)` instead.

## 0.8.2

- Standardized camelCase usage across the codebase:
  - Changed `drop_ids` to `dropIds` in `FetchMomentsInput` interface.
  - Updated `MomentsClient.fetch` method to use the camelCase `dropIds` parameter.
  - GraphQL field names still use snake_case (e.g., `drop_id`) for backend compatibility.

## 0.11.0

- `DropsClient.fetch` property changes:
	- `name` is removed as a filter. Use `DropsClient.search` instead.
	- `isPrivate` is removed as a filter.
	- `from` and `to` date range now filters based on the drop event start and
	end dates, instead of the drop creation date.

## 0.12.0

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: `ProfilesClient.fetchBulk` now returns an object with `profiles` and `errors` maps instead of just a map of profiles. This enables a retry strategy for unresolved profiles.
